# About Me

I'm a queer developer [(it/its)](https://en.pronouns.page/@cb341) working at [Renuo](https://www.renuo.ch/), Software on Rails as a service, while studying Computer Science (BSc) at [ZHAW](https://www.zhaw.ch/) School of Engineering, currently in my second year.

I tend to get very into specific things, and I'd like to eventually work my way toward a PhD. One day I'll have a classroom-sized blackboard in my apartment.

I live in the terminal and like software that does one thing well. No unnecessary abstractions. [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle). I just want things to work. The web is a mess and software has gotten bloated, over-engineered, and slow. I'd rather go back to Rails and a terminal than deal with another layer of indirection. 

I live by open source and have little patience for corporate software culture.

READ THE DOCS.

I love Rust and use it for personal projects, hoping to work on a real production codebase with it someday. Most of my free time goes into building things, or learning about building things. I want to understand the world around me. It takes time.

If you're not an engineer or mathematician, don't expect us to get along. Ask me about Ruby symbols or my favourite parts of IEEE 754, not how the weather's been.

I am trying to make the world a better place.
