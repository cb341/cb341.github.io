    <p>
      I have a deep appreciation for mathematics and find beauty in its logical
      structures and problem-solving approaches. This mathematical mindset helps
      me approach programming challenges with analytical thinking.
    </p>

    <p>
      My technical interests include web development and computer graphics. I
      enjoy creating interactive experiences and exploring the intersection of
      code and visual design.
