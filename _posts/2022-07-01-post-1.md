### Code block

    Code blocks are very useful for developers and other people who look at code or other things that are written in plain text. As you can see, it uses a fixed-width font.

You can also make `inline code` to add code into other things.

```javascript
// This function returns a string padded with leading zeros
function padZeros(num, totalLen) {
  var numStr = num.toString(); // Initialize return value as string
  var numZeros = totalLen - numStr.length; // Calculate no. of zeros
  for (var i = 1; i <= numZeros; i++) {
    numStr = "0" + numStr;
  }
  return numStr;
}
```

## ASCII art

### Quote

> Here is a quote. What this is should be self explanatory. Quotes are automatically indented when they are used.

## Headings

There are six levels of headings. They correspond with the six levels of HTML headings. You've probably noticed them already in the page. Each level down uses one more hash character.

### Headings _can_ also contain **formatting**

### They can even contain `inline code`

Of course, demonstrating what headings look like messes up the structure of the page.

I don't recommend using more than three or four levels of headings here, because, when you're smallest heading isn't too small, and you're largest heading isn't too big, and you want each size up to look noticeably larger and more important, there there are only so many sizes that you can use.

## URLs

URLs can be made in a handful of ways:

- A named link to [MarkItDown][3]. The easiest way to do these is to select what you want to make a link and hit `Ctrl+L`.
- Another named link to [MarkItDown](https://www.markitdown.net/)
- Sometimes you just want a URL like <https://www.markitdown.net/>.

## Horizontal rule

A horizontal rule is a line that goes across the middle of the page.

It's sometimes handy for breaking things up.

## Tables

| Name  | Description                  |
| ----- | ---------------------------- |
| Help  | ~~Display the~~ help window. |
| Close | _Closes_ a window            |

Finally, by including colons : within the header row, you can define text to be left-aligned, right-aligned, or center-aligned:

| Left-Aligned  | Center Aligned  | Right Aligned |
| :------------ | :-------------: | ------------: |
| col 3 is      | some wordy text |         $1600 |
| col 2 is      |    centered     |           $12 |
| zebra stripes |    are neat     |            $1 |

## Finally

There's actually a lot more to Markdown than this :camel:. See the official [introduction][4] and [syntax][5] for more information. However, be aware that this is not using the official implementation, and this might work subtly differently in some of the little things.
